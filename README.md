# sample_code-

Sample code to demonstrate some basic coding/scientific computing skills. This is a classification task with 16,000 and 6,000 examples in the training and test dataset respectively. I tried tree based (xgboost, random forests and catboost) as well as mlp and svc both on original and (non-linearly) dimention reduced dataset. Figures and csv files are inside the outputs folder.
